![Project Image](path/to/your/image.jpg)

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p style="font-size:16px;">This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the housing market by leveraging Python's powerful data analytics and visualization libraries. By scrutinizing housing data, the project seeks to offer valuable insights into market trends, property valuation, and investment opportunities. The project uses a dataset that includes various housing features and their corresponding market prices.</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong>: The primary programming language used for all aspects of analysis and visualization.</li>
    <li><strong>Pandas</strong>: Employed for efficient data manipulation and analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Matplotlib & Seaborn</strong>: Utilized for generating a variety of insightful visualizations.</li>
    <li><strong>NumPy</strong>: Used for numerical operations, particularly for data preprocessing.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Key Features</h1>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
  <ol>
    <li>Data Ingestion: Automated the process of data collection by integrating Python scripts to fetch data from multiple sources.</li>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a preliminary analysis to understand the dataset's structure, identify outliers, and recognize patterns.</li>
    <li>Data Cleaning: Implemented data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and outliers, making the dataset ready for modeling.</li>
