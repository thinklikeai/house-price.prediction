Project Title: Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis Using Python Data Libraries
Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the housing market by leveraging Python's powerful data analytics and visualization libraries. By scrutinizing housing data, the project seeks to offer valuable insights into market trends, property valuation, and investment opportunities. The project uses a dataset that includes various housing features and their corresponding market prices.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for all aspects of analysis and visualization.
Pandas: Employed for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Utilized for generating a variety of insightful visualizations.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations, particularly for data preprocessing.
Key Features
Data Ingestion: Automated the process of data collection by integrating Python scripts to fetch data from multiple sources.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a preliminary analysis to understand the dataset's structure, identify outliers, and recognize patterns.
Data Cleaning: Implemented data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and outliers, making the dataset ready for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing ones to better represent the problem space, improving the model's performance.
Data Visualization: Engineered multiple types of visualizations to represent complex data in a digestible format, aiding in decision-making processes.
Predictive Modeling: (Future Scope) Plan to employ machine learning models to predict housing prices based on multiple features.
